They work together to increase visibility, attract traffic, and convert visitors into customers.

SEO is the process of optimizing a website to rank higher on search engines like Google. It involves using relevant keywords, improving site speed, creating high-quality content, and ensuring mobile-friendliness. There are three main types of SEO:

On-page SEO focuses on optimizing individual pages (titles, meta tags, content).

Off-page SEO involves building backlinks and gaining authority from other trusted websites.
