                <p style="margin-top: 60px; font-size: 20px;">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of every website, defining the elements that appear on a page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms. HTML uses a system of tags enclosed in angle brackets.
               HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, meaning it does not perform logical operations but simply organizes and labels content. To make websites functional and visually appealing, HTML is often used alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).</p>

            <div class="a1"><b style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 900;">CSS</b><p style="margin-top: 60px; font-size: 20px;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS is responsible for how that content looks — including colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, positioning, animations, and responsiveness.CSS supports responsive design through media queries, which adjust styles based on screen size, making websites mobile-friendly. Advanced features include Flexbox and Grid layouts for complex designs, as well as transitions, animations, and custom variables.

        <div class="a1"><b style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 900;">JAVASCRIPT</b><p style="margin-top: 60px; font-size: 20px;">JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language primarily used to add interactivity, logic, and dynamic behavior to websites. While HTML structures a web page and CSS styles it, JavaScript enables users to interact with it — such as clicking buttons, submitting forms, displaying alerts, updating content without reloading the page, and much more.JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it a client-side language, though it can also be used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js. It is one of the core technologies of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
